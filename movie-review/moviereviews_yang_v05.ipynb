      "now i love bela lugosi don t get me wrong he is one of the most interesting people to ever make a movie but he certainly did his share of clunkers this is just another one of those lugosi plays dr lorenz a doctor who has had his medical license pulled for unexplained reasons he is however doing experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful it s revealed that she is 70 80 years old yet lugosi looks to be in his mid 50 s so why he is married to this old woman is never really explained anyway these treatments or experiments involved giving brides who are at the altar being married some sort of sweet smelling substance whereby they pass out but are thought to be dead then lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body on its way to the morgue and take it back to his lab where it s kept in some sort of suspended animation or catatonic state then the stolen brides have a needle rammed somewhere in their bodies maybe the neck and then the needle is rammed into the body of lugosi s wife to bring her back to youth and beauty we never really see where lugosi sticks the needle or what it is that he draws out of the brides but it somehow restores his wife apparently old age makes you scream with pain because lugosi s wife does a lot of screaming until she gets back to her younger state helping lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this movie a weird old hag and her two deformed sons one son is a big lumpy looking slow acting fellow who likes to fondle the snoozing brides and the other son is a mean little dwarf little person to be politically correct in today s world at night these three just sort of pile up and sleep in lugosi s dreary downstairs lab who these 3 are and how they came to be lugosi s scared assistants is like a lot of stuff in this film never explained so anyway a female reporter is given the assignment by her gruff editor to find out where all the stolen brides are going to she quickly figures out that the one common thing among all the stolen brides is a rare orchid that is found on them so she asks around and is told that there is a world renowned orchid expert living nearby who just happens to be the one who developed this particular orchid this expert turns out to be creepy dr lorenz she quickly tracks him down and upsets his little house of horrors i m not sure where the police were during all this but they came in to mop up after the reporter had done all the dirty work it seems that lugosi s movies always had some sort of unnecessary silly plot line that just made the whole thing stink to high heavens i mean a world famous orchid expert kidnaps brides by sending them a doped up orchid he himself is known to have developed d oh and then later it s revealed that the young ladies don t even have to be brides for the procedure to work so why would lugosi keep kidnapping brides from heavily guarded churches for his experiments and create all the attention and newspaper headlines why not just grab a prostitute off the street like a normal weirdo pervert would do this clunker reminded me a lot of another lugosi stinker the devil bat same silly plot lines and bad acting and same silly reporter gets bad guy deal but lugosi is always good he is creepy and sinister enough to keep you interested at least enough to keep watching him the woman playing the reporter was just a terrible actor she had no emotion whatsoever she just delivered her lines like a machine gun spewing them out as quickly as she could everyone else pretty much blew too when it came to being good actors but this thing is watchable if only for bela lugosi fans lugosi was always so intense even when the picture was a dog he must have known he was doing terrible pictures but maybe he also knew that if he gave it everything he had a little of that intensity might shine through past all the bad plots and bad acting which surrounded him and he was right we horror fans will always have a love for bela lugosi he gave it his all every time he was in front of the camera we do give two f ks for you bela \n",

      "this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description but to me it was a bit of a let down very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed definitely not in sequential order also nothing of any consequence was being filmed i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer s part which is different from the typical hollywood film but this one befuddled me to no end i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didn t do anything for me i still don t really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person s life i guess he succeeded but i was looking for more needless to say i can t recommend this movie to anyone \n",

      "when i saw this movie i heard all the hype and i heard how people said that denzel deserved the oscar alongside his golden globe and i believed he must have done an outstanding job considering kevin spacey was excellent i was wrong i realize that people say this not to anger the african american community if they are not african americans themselves i always hear complaints on how african americans are never nominated and how they should have won sometimes this is true not as much nowadays because whoppi goldberg should have won best actress for the color purple and the movie should have won best picture the only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was is because people see a movie about the semi spoiler hardships of an african american during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece denzel washington is an outstanding actor but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever i was bored with him in the movie and his acting here was quite similar to his role in malcolm x but not as good the audience is supposed to leave believing this man rubin carter is a saint people left the movies worshipping this man this hero and they went out and bought his book making this hero of a man rich spoilers this movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit of course the crimes he did commit stealing mostly was only to survive nothing more people felt sorry for him even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife but why wouldn t it after all it is his point of view i do not like movies especially hollywood interpretations that are based on true stories because they usually distort the true parts into something else something not so true this was his point of view and a hollywood construction yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably well i researched his past a bit before making any assumptions and he was a very violent man not only that there is still a possibility that he did murder those people if you do not believe me search for him on the internet and read the articles some people have of him the boxing match he claimed to have won so easily was actually won by his opponent joey giardello and there are tapes to prove it besides that there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie the supporting cast were the nicest people i have ever seen on the face of the earth and their nice and perfect persona looked difficult to keep up this movie was a hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully denzel s acting is stale and the supporting cast s mickey mouse attitudes are annoying the movie also begins very slow paced and is boring \n",

      "spoilers of both this and the matrix follow i liked the original matrix a great deal it was not a deep movie despite fishburne s attempts to philosophize but it was fairly well paced fun and i have a soft spot for hong kong fights in the original neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker anderson by day corporate drone and by night brave hacker eventually he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions does he become an outlaw fighting the machine or does he go back to the safe forgettable world he started in interestingly he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions life rather sucks he has his girl by his side and his boon companions but he eats processed swill dresses in sweats and lives in a truly skungy bit of machinery still the truth makes him free at least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the what if it were me questions raised in the viewer s mind what if _i_ were capable of the impossible what if i were the one it does not even matter that much what you are the one example of with a cool title like that further agent smith made a wonderful bad guy as he embodied all of the fear of authority that we carry with us he was as unstoppable as a terminator and as merciless at the end of the matrix neo must return to the matrix to share his good news of freedom this movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie and it does so with such lack of gusto such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that i cannot believe they had planned these changes when the dialog is at a fifth grade level with various long words dropped in randomly i find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying my short list of characterization failures the oracle goes from mildly helpful if deceitful to utterly obstructionist without any real reason major personalities of the matrix are introduced without need the keymaster for example was a cute idea but just not that interesting a character fishburne loses his advisor role and gets nothing to replace it with the people of zion are not particularly likable nor would you really _want_ them running the world special effects problems the fight scenes are pointless and intermitable in the matrix you felt neo could lose and that he had to become something greater in order to survive in the matrix reloaded he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video game the fight on the freeway looked quite fake and not that interesting pacing problems as i mentioned above the fight scenes were interminable the rave went on too long everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch not because we mind good dancing and good orgies but because we did not know about the people pictured nor did we care whatever hack wrote the creator s soliloquy should be blacklisted from the business it meandered used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand and was a waste of time and a pacing killer the creator s speech could have been done in a tenth the time and with more peril as zion exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the matrix there are now too many people who do not believe the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it further the earth cannot support even the people in zion let alone these others you may choose one person from zion to form the new zion while i wipe the memories of the people currently in the matrix instead we got a long drawn out bunch of twaddle if someone argues that it is deep ask for a transcript and try breaking down the sentences each one is too long by several clauses and uses words with clearer shorter synonyms so in summary not worth seeing i have seen the third one and despite what a number of reviewers have said skip it it does not save this turkey the reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were deep should go see some truly deep movies perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and debate and perhaps a bit of philosophy this movie is just not hard to understand but it is hard to stomach scott \n",

      "this is definitely one of the weirder 70 s movies out there and it s most notable for kicking off a decade of bigfoot hysteria it is also notable for the little touches of insanity throughout the movie especially when the dark moody first half is replaced by a musical interlude of all things as another user pointed out one of the songs is dedicated to a character travis crabtree who paddles around in a canoe for a while then leaves never to be seen again although it s painfully dated now i s still a fun scary movie to show to kids and anyone who enjoys either bigfoot lore or 70 s hillbilly culture is bound to get a kick out of this my favorite part a guy gets so scared that he jumps headfirst through a door and the narrator explains he went unconscious from shock uh i d say breaking a door with his head is more likely why he went unconscious but whatever 4 10 stars or 7 10 if you like bad americana \n",

      "proof why hollywood conventions are in place stale dialogue underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe an attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap together attempt at recreating the magic of arthur penn s bonnie and clyde 1967 and george roy hill s butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 truly innovative filmmakers and films but falling well below the bar problems with storylines being self explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections the editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor stills black white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can t transition well or to replace scenes that just didn t work at all and again are reminiscent of butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 overly dramatic pauses between sentences random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn t needed for storytelling plus over the top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980 s i was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post production the playing of music in most two shots and close ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score no sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots doors footsteps and dialogue a style used in the late 60 s through the mid 70 s by new directors but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads in my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no likeable characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters i wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the hero a necessity for any story to work for me we know from penn s and hill s movies who the heroes are even though they are criminals we like them and want to see them get away i could care less who was on the screen in this film i got the impression that john milius was trying to give off a non historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding john dillenger s life from june 1933 to july 1934 his death to be fair there are some moments of good solid storytelling which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits john milius gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn t seem to try to copy other filmmakers dillinger 1973 isn t a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial big budget debut but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy \n",

      "if you re a fan of the late gram parsons then this movie is definitely going to divide you part comedy part road movie but mostly a bad fictionalization of one of rock history s oddest tales spoilers basically the story concerns a well known roadie named phil kaufman played by johnny knoxville who supposedly made a pact with cult rock country folk music hero gram parsons that stated when one of them died first it didn t matter which one it was that the other living one was to take the deceased out to the desert joshua tree national park in california to be exact and set the body ablaze so as to free the spirit and become one with the earth and so on sure to keep his word the barely sober kaufman with the assistance of a self hating pot headed buddy jacks the body of the late parsons whom had fatally overdosed from a drug and booze bender a day prior from the airport and shortly after that what ensues is a cringe worthy combination of fiction and truth where the late parsons girlfriend kaufman s girlfriend parsons stone faced father and a gaggle of police officers and other pointless idiotic characters all try to beat the clock so to speak in trying to catch kaufman and his pal before they get the chance to torch parsons body the film s incompetent direction bad acting and lame offbeat tone in general all sink this movie faster than the titanic and not to mention the huge fact that this movie is not even halfway telling the truth of the actual events that took place the accuracies that should have replaced the inaccuracies as far as i ve heard them include number 1 parsons was married at the time of his death and even had a child so what the hell was that all about with the girlfriend s and the chasing and whatnot number 2 kaufman s drugged out buddy was a known willing participant unlike what the movie attempts to portray in the disposing of parson s body and finally number 3 gram parsons real life father died when he was just a boy and so it was parson s step father who could have honestly cared less about gram parsons when he was still alive in real life that took care of the body after it was torched altogether though what probably disturbs me the most about this movie is that the real phil kaufman was actually on set to help assist with the facts of the story and yet still the movie ended up becoming so untrue and so bad that it really boggles my mind frankly also as the mediocre aforementioned acting in the film is concerned it s lead character played by the ultra grating johnny knoxville phil kaufman is not only a bad actor but it actually seems as if he were asleep throughout most of the movie and the rest of the pathetic cast are for the most part either hysterical brain dead or seem utterly clueless as to what they re actually doing there in the first place overall if you like johnny knoxville and or really dig the so bad they re not even good buddy flicks then i suppose you just might get a kick out of this movie but if you re like me and are a fan of the late gram parsons enjoy films that attempt to tell the truth as much as they can especially if they re based on an actual real life story and or you just like good films be them road movies or fictional slice of life stuff you will truly loathe this film and advise others to do likewise i obviously hated this movie and wished it had never been made in the first place but since it was made i would have preferred it to have turned out differently than what it did unfortunately maybe some day the real facts of the story will come through and be made into a really great biopic on all of gram parsons life not just what happened to his body after his spirit left it but until that time comes all we as an audience and or fans of the late performer get is this sad waste of film and an all around terrible memorial of sorts to the musical legacy that gram parsons was known to have left behind it should also be noted that they did actually use parsons music and a few others as well in the flick but not surprisingly though you never get to hear enough of it to really enjoy it even in the slightest bit turkey zero stars \n",

      " this is a review of the later english release by disney featuring alison lohman patrick stewart and co i really wanted this film to be good really really i m a huge fan of princess mononoke and spirited away and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film i was eager to see it but i was shocked shocked i say at the quality of this film those later films boast well crafted plots 3 dimensional characters and the best film music since well ever this film just doesn t come close might as well start w the positive aspects though like all miyazaki films this one is still very imaginative with a bizarre fantasy sci fi setting in a post apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time though not as beautiful and fluid as miyazaki s later films and the english voice acting is quite well done but this film just isn t good the characters are all cardboard from saccharine sweet little nausicaa to the ruthlessly evil tolmekians to everyone in between once you ve seen each of them for 30 seconds you ve seen all there is and the fact that the plot just ambles along doesn t help then there s the music now hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer but nausicaa doesn t do him justice half the music is 80 s keyboards on overdrive and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them i highly suspect that hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picture but wait there s a great message with this film right let s all save the environment too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer there is a scene in which nausicaa hugs a tree no really i ain t kidding it makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is but for some reason all the other reviews on imdb seem to adore it and when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you what s going on that s lame if you re the kind of person who worships anime enjoys 80 s music and plants a tree every arbor day you will probably like this film otherwise save your money for his later films because they rock big time \n",

      "the howling ii starts as it means to go on with a bizarre and surreal opening narration by christopher lee whose image is imposed over a moving star field oh and a skeleton appears as well for some reason he says for it s written the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with her blood and i saw her sip upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden challis full of the filthiest fornication s and upon her forehead was written behold i am the great mother of an inaudible word i couldn t make out no matter how many times i rewound the tape and tried to sorry and all abominations of the earth this opening narration means nothing at all and is just downright bizarre after the opening credits which are set over shots of transylvanian architecture we get an on screen caption that informs us we re in los angeles california u s a city of the angels i knew i was in for a long 86 minutes it s probably not too long after the events of the original howling 1981 and it s karen white s funeral after the ceremony karen s brother ben reb brown is spoken to by an occult investigator called stefan crosscoe christopher lee who says that karen is a werewolf and that she will come back to life ben dismisses such nonsense but together with one of karen s friends and colleagues jenny annie mcenroe he visits stefan at his home there stefan tells them about werewolves and how they can be killed he mentions stirba sybil danning who is the queen of werewolves stefan also shows them a photograph taken at karen s funeral of a woman named mariana marsha a hunt and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous werewolf who wants karen stefan says he will stake any werewoves through the heart with titanium ben figures out that stefan means he will stake karen as well so together with jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sister s crypt is to stop stefan however lots of werewolves turn up and attack stefan ben and jenny they survive the attack and manage to find out that stirba is to be found in transylvania they all decide to travel to transylvania and stop stirba and her werewolves from taking over the earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse once there they travel to a small town called vlkava which means where wolves live and meet up with the local priest father florin ladislav krecmer and his small but loyal group of werewolf hunters hey what else can i call them oh and a dwarf named florica ludmila safarova helps too they follow mariana who they hope will lead them to stirba but stirba knows of stefan s arrival and has plans for him ben and jenny will stefan be able to put an end to stirba s plans for world domination will this film get any more bizarre or surreal watch it and find out directed by philippe mora this is one strange mess of a film it s poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around incoherently the single biggest problem is the script by robert sano and gary brandner based on his novel which is all over the place and doesn t make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring unlike the original something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained most people will probably hate it but for those of us who enjoy bad films this is right up there with the best of them there are werewolf orgies which are just freaky to watch we get some cool werewolf killing weaponry the sets and locations just seem so out of place and i don t know if this was actually shot in transylvania but it doesn t look like what i thought mid 80 s transylvania would stirba s castle is part dungeon part gothic castle and part modern luxury house stirba and her servant s costumes are very over the top stirba wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a s m video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy and her minions wear skimpy leather clothing too the special make up effects range from good to poor a dwarf s eyes explode someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this isn t a film loaded with gore although there are plenty of effect sequences with werewolf transformations and attacks there is plenty of nudity as well as stirba and her minions are a real randy bunch of werewolves i should also mention the music the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that i hated and i ended up turning the volume down acting is weak all round and what on earth was christopher lee thinking about when he accepted this film i wonder what he thinks of it basically the whole thing is a real mess but i found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage it also features the same shot of sybil danning taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times if that s your thing \n",

      "what a great actor to have in such an awful story the film and its production however is quite good even though set in london but with exteriors in bristol no matter see one cathedral you ve seen em all sort of the story however is about a man born with the power to wreak death and destruction upon anybody and anything should he so wish with just a passing reference to true life instances of telekinesis the narrative builds a picture of a man misused and misjudged as a boy a teenager and finally as a man so much so in fact that he exacts vengeance at will literally over time he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the lot just by thinking about it the trouble with the narrative however is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge it all with quasi religious claptrap to produce a hodge podge theory about it all mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works and i m afraid richard burton had to overact awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing his very best scene however is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal pasting as they left his home sharp witty and deadly dialog delivered as only burton could a good supporting cast helps to make things look and sound a lot better though beginning with lino ventura whom i last saw in garde a vu 1981 as inspector brunel harry andrews as assistant commissioner the much under rated lee remick as dr zonfeld derek jacobi as a publisher towney and a few other well known character actors i liked the way the story was presented as flashback within flashback to fill in the back story and thus solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of morlar richard burton the writer with the killer disposition up till that point it was a good piece of visual detective work by brunel and his english sidekick still it was very predictable as it became quickly very obvious to me about the identity of the would be murderer then they went and spoilt it all in the last fifteen minutes if you want a clue about what that is think samson and delilah 1949 from the illustrious cecil b de mille and how samson got the bad guys in the end and the very last scene is just plain stupid why because there are at least a hundred ways that morlar s rampaging could have been stopped absolutely shame actually because this could have been a lot better story and movie i guess burton really needed the money if you re burton fan then spend the time to see that scene i mentioned above otherwise don t bother \n",

this film was loathed from day one while every now and then one will come across some maverick who will praise the film on philosophical grounds aggressive feminism or the courage to tackle the issue of transgenderism the film has not developed a cult following like some notorious flops do it s not hailed as a misunderstood masterpiece like scarface or trotted out to be ridiculed as a camp classic like showgirls undoubtedly the reason is that the film though outrageously awful is not lovable or even likable myra breckinridge is just plain mean as a hollywood satire it is cold blooded and mean spirited but in a hollow pointless way myra takes for granted that hollywood is a corrupt town but goes further to attack such beloved icons as laurel and hardy shirley temple judy garland and gary cooper the film seems to imply that everything about hollywood is by its very nature vile it seems to think that there is something inherently courageous about mocking sacred cows but doesn t supply a rationale for doing the mocking in the first place the film is also viscously anti american and anti establishment and anti this and anti that but all in a superficial late 1960 s trendy way like casino royale ski doo i love you alice b toklas and other would be hip epics myra is a middle aged vision of the hippy dippy youth culture it tries to embrace the very attitude that it belittles but instead of being cheerfully self mocking myra makes no attempt to conceal its contempt for everything that comes within its grasp myra breckinridge has the humor of a bully there s not a single moment of innocence in it its intentions aren t honorable time magazine aptly described it as being about as funny as a child molester but it s not nearly as sympathetic for instance poor mae west bore the brunt of so much of the criticism aimed at the film being described as looking like everything from an aging drag queen to a reanimated walking corpse the octogenarian star obviously didn t know just how ridiculous she looked playing a lecherous talent agent lusting after men young enough to be her grandsons or even her great grandsons but director michael sarne had to know but he used her anyway why because she apparently was the joke just like john huston john carradine grady sutton andy devine and other veteran performers in the film they are there only so the film can mock their age and use them to trash their film images they are cast as smarmy self parodies as is rex reed the arrogant fey film critic who is cast as just that in the film but the real reed the celebrity hound jet setting talk show gossip can be charming in an obnoxiously funny way but as myron myra s alter ego he is just obnoxious again apparently for sarne reed is the joke you watch myra breckinridge and you don t see actors you see victims none more so than raquel welch no one will ever accuse welch of being a great actress but it is a testament to her tenacity and her appeal that she survived this film and her career prospered being in almost every scene welch was front and center as a target for abuse aimed at the film but to her credit she gives a remarkably nuanced performance though of course centered between the scenery chewing huston and the almost catatonic west welch doesn t have to do much to strike a good balance even so she renders her horribly unfunny dialogue with a deadpan smirk with just the hint of self righteous glee that would do any james bond villain proud legend has it that welch was snubbed by a condescending west and subjected to repeated verbal abuse on the set by bumbling director sarne not to mention being featured in one degrading scene after another making it all the more remarkable that she was able to give such a cool and collected performance the film s only intriguing element is trying to figure out just what the film s agenda is the whole story is a fantasy fable which should indicate that it has a moral to deliver but what that might be is anybody s guess with all of its talk about destroying the last vestigial traces of traditional manhood from the race it would seem to have a feminist axe to grind but as a feminist myra is a monstrous figure a sexual predator besides myra isn t a woman rather she is a delusion of myron who presumably is a gay male that might explain the male rape scene as well as the character s love hate attitude toward the macho seemingly straight deadhead rusty but it doesn t explain his her obsession for and the supposedly lesbian tryst with farrah fawcett s mary ann the film is obsessed with sex but can hardly be accused of being in favor of the sexual revolution all the sex is treated as being if not dirty than at least perverse and degrading turning to gore vidal s original novel isn t of any help because it is as confused and pointless as the movie and this is a rare movie that actually seems to hate movies not just movies as a business but movies as part of the culture as well the film itself is wall to wall arcane references to old movies all of which director screenwriter sarne approaches with a seething disdain he has raided the film vaults of 20th century fox and peppered the film with snippets of old films not as an homage or to provide a social commentary but to mock the innocence of old hollywood how can an artist if you generously want to call sarne that make a work of art if he already hates the very medium he is working in the very effort is totally self defeating myra breckinridge doesn t seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty it hates hollywood it hates america it hates sex it hates gays and straights and women and men and old people and young people and laurel and hardy and well you name it and it probably has a scene showing contempt for it in a very sad and sorry way myra breckinridge may be the first punk manifesto a celebration of pop culture nihilism \n",
