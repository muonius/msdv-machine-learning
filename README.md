# Introduction

This is the summary documentation of my course study of Machine Learning at Parsons' Data Visualization MS porgram in Spring 2022.

In the first five weeks, we practiced in a modular format and then we moved onto three machine learning projects.

- **Week 01:** Basic linear model fitting
- **Week 02:** Python practice
- **Week 03:** Basic machine learning fitting
- **Week 04:** Multiple models
- **Week 05:** Bag of Words

- **Project 1:** Movie Reviews | Natural Language Processing

  In this project, I experimented with multiple natural language processing tools to create a binary predictor of movie reviews. I worked with bag of words, Tfidf, sparse matrix, and text pre-processing techniques such as part of speech tagging and lemmatization. I used Ridged Regression and simple Bag of Words along with regulation to acheive the best outcome.

- **Project 2:** Image Recognition | Deep Learning

  In this project, I experimented with various Skimage tools to process images and pass the image features into both Perceptron and multi-layer Perceptron Models. I acheived best model outcome by using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and simple Perceptron.

- **Project 3:** Food Description Clustering | Unsupervised Learning

  Drawing from lessons of the previous two projects, it seems that the simpler the model is the powerful the result is. In this project, I used a simple Bag of Words to extract food description features and KMean clustering.
